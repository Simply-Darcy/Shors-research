# Shor's research
Quantum algorithm: Shor's prime number factor finding algorithm research project

To-do:
Refactor Jupyter code, clean up all unused code and comments
Calculate time complexity(s) for each function, attempt to make them more effecient if possible
Create alternate version of the algorithm in both JavaScript and C#
Compare time and space complexity for each language

Further research:
Explore if there is a correlation between the random guess used for the post-processing arithmetic to calculate the factors and their position along the range. If the selected guess was usable and provides a solution to the difference of two *squares*, was it more likely to be found eg. in the first 30% of the available guess range.
